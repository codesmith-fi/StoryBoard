Simple ticketing system datastructure with unit tests using my own simple 
"framework" for testing which was implemented as a part of this assignment.

UML Class/Model design can be found in doc/01_Design.xmi (also screeshot 
is provided).
It has been made using Umbrello open source UML Modeler software which 
is available for Linux and Windows atleast.

This was programmed under linux (Ubuntu 19.10) using GCC and Eclipse.

    Note instances.

    a title, description and a list of tags.
